# Using this cookiecutter

There are two prerequisites:
 1. Git needs to be available on your system
 2. You need to have cookiecutter installed. General instructions are
 [here](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html),
 but `pip install cookiecutter` should be enough in most cases.

Then do this in a terminal:

```
cd /where/you/store/your/projects
cookiecutter https://github.com/renefritze/python_cookiecutter
```

Answer the prompts and cookiecutter generates a new directory
with the given name.
